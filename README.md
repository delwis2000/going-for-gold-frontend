# Going For Gold!

Going For Gold is a Jeapordy-like game where one person will act as the host and interact with the app. The host can share their screen with the players of the game and play through a game! Pick a question on the board, and the first player to guess correctly wins the money and gets control of the board. Any incorrect answers will result in losing money. At the end of the game, the player with the most money gets their winnings added to their running total!

The database will reset to its initial state when the backend server goes idle, so any players and games added will persist for a while but not permanently.

## If Running Locally

To run this app locally, use `npm install` then `npm start` to run the frontend. The backend will also need to be running, see instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/fitzgeraldkd/going-for-gold-backend) for instructions on running the backend.
